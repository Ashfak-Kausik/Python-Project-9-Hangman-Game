# Python-Project-9-Hangman-Game
Creating a simple Hangman game where the player has to guess the word one letter at a time.

How the Game Works:
1. Word Selection: The game selects a random word from a predefined list.
2. Guessed Letters: The player guesses one letter at a time. Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word, while incorrect guesses decrease the number of remaining attempts.
3. Victory or Loss: The player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts. If they run out of attempts, they lose, and the game reveals the correct word.
